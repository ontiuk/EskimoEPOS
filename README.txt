The EskimoEPOS WordPress plugin integrates the EskimoEPOS e-commerce system into Woocommerce via connection to it's API via the WordPress REST API.

== Description ==

The EskimoEPOS WordPress plugin integrates the EskimoEPOS e-commerce system into Woocommerce via connection to it's API via the WordPress REST API.

- EPOS Product import 
- EPOS Category import
- Simple and Variable product import
	- Stock management
	- SKU
	- 2-way Web_ID synchronisation
- Woocommerce Order EPOS export
	- Automatic EPOS stock update (by EPOS) from Woocommerce order lines
- Stock, Price & Tax product synchronisation (EPOS to Woocommerce)

The plugin uses WordPress best-practices and cutting-edge functionality to integrate the EskimoEPOS API into Woocommerce.
This uses the WordPress REST API to generate custom API Endpoints which map to the Eskimo EPOS system API core functionality.
Authorisation is by oauth tokenisation. This is generated by initial request to the api and then cached until timeout for subsequent API callauthorisation.

Requires: WordPress 5.0+, Woocommerce 3+, PHP 7.2+

Example: http://domainxxx.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/order-create/xxx

Analysis: Broken down this url comprises 3 parts:
http://domainxxx.com/wp-json/	- The path to the WordPress instance REST API base url
eskimo/v1						- The Eskimo plugin namespace. All custom endpoints are tied to this namespace
/order-create/xxx				- The API endpoint. In this example order-create and a woocommerce order ID (xxx)

All urls are permalink based and require that the WordPress permalinks are active i.e other than the WordPress query string default. WP-Admin > Settings > Permalink.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `eskimo` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the integrated plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Woocommerce > Settings > Eskimo and add the Eskimo Username & Password
4. Set other API settings & enable the endpoints

== Eskimo Admin ==
The plugin creates a new 'Eskimo' tab in the Woocommerce settings panel: WP-Admin > Woocommerce > Settings. 

The EskimoEPOS settings tab contains API fields for the Eskimo API URL, and your Eskimo Username and Password.
There are also additional custom Web_ID fields which prepend a value to the generated Eskimo EPOS product and category Web_ID fields, and Order ExternalReference field. 
These are used by the plugin as validation during import of EskimoEPOS products and categories, and export of Woocommerce orders, to avoid duplicates.

The Woocommerce EskimoEPOS REST API endpoints can also be enabled/disabled. 
It is recommended that this is disabled and only enabled when requiring to
process an import, unless automatic order/stock synchronisation (cron) is required (see below).

Settings:
API Enabled		- Enable Woocommerce EskimoEPOS REST API Endpoints
API Username	- EskimoEPOS API Username
API Password	- EskimoEPOS API Password

Category Web_ID Prefix	- Prepended to category ID to create category Web_ID
Product Web_ID Prefix	- Prepended to category ID to create product Web_ID
Customer Web_ID Prefix	- Prepended to order ID & customer IDs to create a unique external reference

== Using the REST API ==
When the Eskimo REST API endpoints are made available, through the setting above, this generates a number of custom urls which can be used to connect to the EskimoEPOS API. 
These are detailed below:

== API Call Details ==

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/categories **

Imports EskimoEPOS Categories into Woocommerce. Restricted to 2-levels: Parent - Child. 

For every EskimoEPOS category imported into Woocommerce a unique Web_ID is generated which is exported to the EskimoEPOS category Web_ID field.
This is set as a custom Woocommerce meta-data value tied to the Woocommerce category. This is used to map EskimoEPOS categories to Woocommerce categories.

The Web_ID value is displayed as a column in the Categories listing page, single category edit page. 
Also shown as a field in the custom EskimoEPOS tab in the Product Data panel of the Woocommerce product edit page. 

Return value: JSON {"route":"categories","params":"all","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]} 
Result is an empty array for no import, or displays an array list [ 'Eskimo_Category_ID' => {Eskimo_Category_ID}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ]
Used to update EskimoEPOS system Web_IDs.

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/categories-new **

Alias for the /categories API import.

This is the preferred method for once the primary categories are imported.
Adding an action hook and setting up a cron job to call this would be a suitable usage.

Checks if the category has already been importing via the web_ID field content generated at import. If this exists then the category is ignored.

To reimport a category use the /category-update API call to first empty the web_ID field and then delete the Woocommerce product category by ID.

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/category/(id:integer)/(type:string) **

Imports a single EskimoEPOS category into Woocommerce categories. The url takes the EskimoEPOS category ID as the parameter.

By default EskimoEPOS categories are pipe (|) delimited, e.g. 001|Product. This character is not a recommended unencoded url character. 
To keep urls clean and avoid manual encoding of the | character the urls
replace the | character with a split parameter in 2 url fields e.g. 130/product -> 130|product. 
These are internally validate and translated by the plugin, and stored as their original EskimoEPOS pipe delimited versions.

When the EskimoEPOS category is imported into Woocommerce a uniqie Web_ID setting is generated. 
This is exported to the EskimoEPOS category Web_ID field of the particular category. 
It is also set as a custom meta-data value tied to the Woocommerce category. 
The Web_ID setting is used to map the EskimoEPOS category to the Woocommerce category, and as validation for future category imports to avoid duplicates.

Return value: JSON {"route":"category","params":"cat_id: 130|product","nonce":"0753674aae","result":false}
Result is false for no import, or an array [ 'Eskimo_Category_ID' => {Eskimo_Category_ID}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ] 
Used to update the EskimoEPOS category Web_ID

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/child-categories/(id:integer)/(type:string) **

Imports child categories of a a single EskimoEPOS parent category into Woocommerce. The url takes the EskimoEPOS parent category ID as the parameter.

As with the /category API endpoint the EskimoEPOS category url format should use 2 fields  instead of pipe characters in the category ID e.g. 6/product -> 6|product.

As with the single category a Web_ID is automatically generated. This is exported to the EskimoEPOS system category web_ID field. 
Also set as meta-data for the Woocommerce category and used to map EskimoEPOS parent category to Woocommerce category. Used as validation for future imports to avoid duplicates.

Return value: JSON {"route":"child-category","params":"cat_id: 6|product","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is an empty array for no import, or displays an array list [ 'Eskimo_Category_ID' => {Eskimo_Category_ID}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ]
Used to update EskimoEPOS system Web_IDs.

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/categories-update **

Updates the EskimoEPOS Category Web_IDs from the Woocommerce category values
This is generally a one-off API call. Useful when moving from am EskimoEPOS test database to the live version where the 2 databases are copies of each other. Avoids the need to reimport all the categories.

Return value: JSON {"route":"categories-update","params":"all","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no categories, or an array list [ 'Eskimo_Category_ID' => {Eskimo_Category_ID}, 'Web_ID' => 0 ] 
Used to update the EskimoEPOS category Web_ID.

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/categories-reset **

Resets all EskimoEPOS system Web_IDs. Warning, this can not be undone!

By default once an EskimoEPOS category is imported to Woocommerce a Web_ID is generated and exported to the EskimoEPOS system. 
This is also set as meta-data for the Woocommerce categor. This provides an entry point validation for subsequent imports. 
If all categories are required to be reimported e.g. when setting up a new Wordpress/Woocommerce instance then all Web_IDs need to be reset.

If a single category needs to be re-imported then use the single category endpoint below.

Return value: JSON {"route":"categories-reset","params":"all","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or an array list [ 'Eskimo_Category_ID' => {Eskimo_Category_ID}, 'Web_ID' => 0 ] 
Used to update the EskimoEPOS category Web_ID.

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/categories-meta **

Updates the Woocommerce EPOS category meta field from the EskimoEPOS Category values

Each Woocommerce category when imported from EskimoEPOS sets the EskimoEPOS category ID as a custom term meta data field against the Woocommerce categoryterm. 
This is used to map EskimoEPOS categories against Woocommerce categories for reference and to avoid import duplication.

This is generally a one-off API call. Useful when moving from am EskimoEPOS test database to the live version where the 2 databases are copies of each
other. Avoids the need to reimport all the categories. It overwrites existing Woocommerce values for the EskimoEPOS Category ID.

Return value: JSON {"route":"categories-meta","params":"all","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no categories, or an array list [ 'Eskimo_Category_ID' => {Eskimo_Category_ID} ] 

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/category-update/(id:integer)/(type:string)/(value:string) **

Resets a single EskimoEPOS system category Web_ID. Warning, this can not be undone.

This allows an EskimoEPOS category Web_ID to be reset, or updated to a new value.
For example if the existing Woocommerce category Web_ID value has been manually changed. 

By default once an EskimoEPOS category is imported to Woocommerce a Web_ID is generated and exported to the EskimoEPOS system. 
This is also set as meta-data for the Woocommerce category. This provides validation entry-point for subsequent imports. 

If a category is to be reimported then the Web_ID value should be 0. This sets the remote Web_ID field to null.
As for single category import above, the EskimoEPOS category should use split
2 fields in place of the pipe character. For example: 130/product -> 130|product.

Update: e.g. https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/category-update/130-product/cxc-1234
Reset:  e.g. https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/category-update/130-product/0

Return value: {"route":"category-update","params":"cat_id: 6|product","nonce":"0753674aae","result": false}
Result is false for no import, or an array [ 'Eskimo_Category_ID' => {Eskimo_Category_ID}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ] 
Used to update the EskimoEPOS category Web_ID. If the category Web_ID is to be reset then the Web_ID value is 0.

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/category-products/(start)/(records) **

Imports all products by category and range. Deprecated, DO NOT USE. Use /products end-point below.

Historical implementation of the EskimoEPOS /category-products API url. Replaced by the more suitable /products API call. 
Imports by batch arange, with a start & end point, represented by xxx & yyy.

Return value: JSON {"route":"category-products","params":"range","range":"{start},{records}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or an array [ 'Eskimo_Identifier' => {eskimo_identifier}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ];

https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/category-product/(id:integer)/(type:string) 

Retrieves all products by category and range. Deprecated, do NOT use. Use /products-all below.

Historical implementation of the EskimoEPOS /category-products API url. Replaced by the more suitable /products-all API call. 
Imports all products by internal batches. Warning, very resource intensive!!

Return value: JSON {"route":"category-products-all","params":"range","range":"1,20","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or an array [ 'Eskimo_Identifier' => {eskimo_identifier}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ];

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/products/(start:integer)/(records:integer) **

Imports all EskimoEPOS products by batch range, with a start & record count. 
For example, importing 20 records starting at record 100: https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/products/20/100.

Note, there is a limit on the number of records that can be imported in a batch. This is set to 50 for resource purposes. 
This represents the parent product count. If a product has variations e.g. 60 variations, all these will be imported and the import will increment by 1. 
For shops with lots of product variations small batch numbers are recommended. 

When EskimoEPOS products are imported into Woocommerce a Web_ID is generated and exported to the EskimoEPOS system. 
This is set in the relevent EskimoEPOS product Web_ID field, and used for validation & mapping for future imports. 
It is also set as meta-data for the imported Woocommerce product. Already imported products will be skipped during future imports.

The product and category Web_ID values for the Woocommerce product can be seen in the Product Listing page in Wordpress Admin > Products.
Also in the custom Eskimo tab in the Product Edit page product data section.
  
Return value: JSON {"route":"products","params":"range","range":"{start},{records}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or an array list [ 'Eskimo_Identifier' => {eskimo_identifier}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ] 
Used for update of EskimoEPOS product Web_IDs;

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/products-all **

Imports all Eskimo EPOS products. Note this is highly resource intensive. 
For imports containing a lot of products and/or product variations use the product batch import above. 
Should be used for small ( ~100s ) imports of products only, and simple or limited variations products only.

Uses internal batch importing, importing from the start to the finish. 
As each product is imported the Web_ID field is generated as below. 
The means that this can be run multiple times. Already imported products will be skipped.

When an EskimoEPOS product is imported into Woocommerce a Web_ID is generated and exported to the EskimoEPOS system.

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product/(id:integer)/(style:string)/(trade:string)/(import:integer) **

Retrieves a single EskimoEPOS product into Woocommerce. The url takes the EskimoEPOS product ID as the parameter.

By default EskimoEPOS products are pipe (|) delimited, e.g. 1|MAC||. This character is not a recommended unencoded url character. 
To keep urls clean and avoid manual encoding of the | character the urls
replace the | character with a split fields e.g. 1/MAC/001-000010 -> 1|MAC|001-000010|.
These are internally translated by the plugin and stored as their original EskimoEPOS versions.

If no trade ID field is used then replace this with 0. 1/MAC/0 -> 1|MAC||.

The final field is an optional import field. By default the product is not imported. To import then add 1. If no import is required, and no trade ID is
used then the final fields can be ignored, e.g. 

retrieve: 	1/MAC/001-000010 	-> 1|MAC|001-000010|
import: 	1/MAC/001-000010/1 	-> 1|MAC|001-000010| & import if required
retrieve: 	1/MAC 				-> 1|MAC||
import: 	1/MAC/0/1 			-> 1|MAC|| & import if required

When the EskimoEPOS product is imported into Woocommerce a Web_ID is generated and exported to the EskimoEPOS system. 
This is exported to the EskimoEPOS product Web_ID field. It is also set as meta-data for the Woocommerce product, and displayed in the Product Listing and Product Edit Wordpress Admin pages. 
This is used for validation & mapping for future imports. Already imported products will be skipped in future imports.

Return value: JSON {"route":"product","params":"prod_id: {prod_id}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or an array [ 'Eskimo_Identifier' => {eskimo_identifier}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ] for update of EskimoEPOS product Web_ID;

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/products-update **

Updates the EskimoEPOS Product Web_IDs from the Woocommerce product values

This is generally a one-off API call. Useful when moving from am EskimoEPOS test database to the live version where the 2 databases are copies of each
other. Avoids the need to reimport all the products. Note this works at the product level and not the SKU level.

Return value: JSON {"route":"categories-update","params":"all","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no categories, or an array list [ 'Eskimo_Category_ID' => {Eskimo_Category_ID}, 'Web_ID' => 0 ] 
Used to update the EskimoEPOS category Web_ID.

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/products-reset/(start:integer)/(records:integer) **

Resets EskimoEPOS product Web_IDs. Processes by batch range, with start and record count. Warning, this can not be undone.

This allows a batch of product Web_IDs to be reset. 

This would allow for reimporting of all products from EskimoEPOS to Woocommerce, for example if creating a new instance of WordPress / Woocommerce. 
For single product reimport use the product import below. For product record updates, use the product update below.

Return value: JSON {"route":"products-update","params":"range","range":"{start},{records}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or an array list [ 'Eskimo_Identifier' => {eskimo_identifier}, 'Web_ID' => 0 ] 
Used for update of EskimoEPOS product Web_IDs.

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-update/(id:integer)/(style:string)/(trade:string)/(value:string) **

Resets a single EskimoEPOS product Web_ID. Warning, this can not be undone.

By default EskimoEPOS products are pipe (|) delimited, e.g. 1|MAC||. This character is not a recommended unencoded url character. 
To keep urls clean and avoid manual encoding of the | character the urls replace the | character with a split fields e.g. 
1/MAC/0/XXX -> 1|MAC|| & XXX, or 1/MAC/001-000010/XXX -> 1|MAC|001-000010| & XXX. 
These are internally translated by the plugin and stored as their original EskimoEPOS versions.

This allows a product Web_ID to be reset, or updated to a new value, for example if the existing Woocommerce product Web_ID value has been manually changed. 
If a product is to be reimported then the value should be 0. As above, the product should use a dash in place of the pipe character. For example:

Update: http://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/category-update/1/MAC/000010/cxp-1234
Reset:  http://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/category-update/0/001-000001/0/cxp-1234

Return value: JSON {"route":"product-update","params":"prod_id:{prod_id}","prod_value: {prod_value}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or an array [ 'Eskimo_Identifier' => {eskimo_identifier}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ] 
Used for update of EskimoEPOS product Web_IDs. Reset value is 0, Update value non-zero string;

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-import/(type:string)/(id:integer)/(style:string)/(trade:string) **

This allows partial import and update of an EskimoEPOS product into an existing Woocommerce product record by EskimoEPOS product ID.

This allows the update of stock qty, price, or tax values of a Woocommerce product from the equivalent EskimoEPOS record. 
The type of update is taken from the first parameter, and the selected EskimoEPOS record the second parameter, for example:

https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-import/stock/1/MAC/001-000010
https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-import/price/1/MAC/001-000010
https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-import/tax/1/MAC/001-000010
https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-import/adjust/1/MAC/001-000010

Adjust mode includes both stock qty and price.

By default EskimoEPOS products are pipe (|) delimited, e.g. 001|MAC||. This character is not a recommended unencoded url character. 
To keep urls clean and avoid manual encoding of the | character the urls replace the | character with split fields e.g. 1/MAC/001-000010 -> 1|MAC|001-000010|. 
These are internally translated by the plugin and stored as their original EskimoEPOS versions.

The Woocommerce value is selectively updated from the EskimoEPOS record. 
Useful to avoid full reimporting of the EskimoEPOS product to Woocommerce, for example if a product price has changed, or after a stock take, or change of tax status.

Return value: JSON {"route":"product-import","path":"{prod_type},"params":"prod_id:{prod_id}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or an array [ 'Eskimo_Identifier' => {eskimo_identifier}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ];

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-adjust/(id:integer)/(style:string)/(trade:string) **

This is an alias for the above /product-import API call and used the adjust mode as default. 
This is the common usage and syncs the changes products set by the EPOS system on a product sale.

https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-adjust/1/MAC/001-000010
https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-adjust/1/MAP

Return value: JSON {"route":"product-import","path":"adjust,"params":"prod_id:{prod_id}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or an array [ 'Eskimo_Identifier' => {eskimo_identifier}, 'Web_ID' => {Web_ID} ];

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-trade/(id:integer)/(style:string)/(trade:string) **

This updates the remote EPOS product trade customer ID. If a product is pre-imported as a generic product it may not be assigned to a trade ID. 
If a product is then reassigned to a trade ID / department then it acquires a trade customer ID setting, e.g. 1|MAC|| -> 1|MAC|001-000010| when assigned to department 001-000010.

https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/product-trade/1/MAC/001-000010

Return value: JSON {"route":"product-trade","params":"prod_id:{prod_id}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/customer/(id:string)/(import:integer) **

Retrieves and/or imports an EskimoEPOS customer into Woocommerce by EskimoEPOS customer ID. 

In reality it is not particularly relevent to import an EskimoEPOS cutomer into Woocommerce, unless they are later to generate Web sales. 
Even in this situation due to EskimoEPOS having limited fields which don't exactly map the Woocommerce equivalents it is recommended that the customer is manually created through the WordPress Admin UI. 
The customer-update endpoint below can then be used to generate a customer ExternalReference to map Woocommerce customer to EskimoEPOS customer. Note that the key used for validation is the email address.

Return value: JSON {"route":"customer","params":"ID:{cust_id}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or a string 'User ID[{$user_id}] Username[{$username}]';

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/customer-exists/(email:string) **/

Interrogates the EskimoEPOS system to test whether a customer exists.

This is done by customer email as the primary key, for example:
https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/customer-exists/email@domainurl.com

Return value: JSON 
{"route":"customer-exists","params":"Email: trutex@macclesfield.com","nonce":"c77e17e4f6","result":false}

Result is false for no customer and true for an existing customer.

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/customer-insert/(id:integer) **/

Exports a Woocommerce customer to EskimoEPOS by Woocommerce customer ID.

This takes a WordPress/Woocommerce user - containing standard WordPress user details, and Woocommerce billing and shipping details and exports to EskimoEPOS. Validation is by email address. If this is already present in the EskimoEPOS system then import will fail.

Return value: JSON {"route":"customer-create","params":"ID:{cust_id}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or a string 'ID[{$user_id}] EPOS ID[{$epos_customer_id}]';

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/customer-update/(id:integer) **/

Updates an EskimoEPOS customer's record on the EskimoEPOS system if previously exported from Woocommerce, or if the EskimoEPOS user already existed. 
The validation is done via the customer email address.

Takes a WordPress/Woocommerce user - containing standard WordPress user details, and Woocommerce billing and shipping details. 
Exports to EskimoEPOS. Validation is by email address. If this is already present in the EskimoEPOS system then the update will overwrite all valid fields with the exported record. 
Note, this cannot be undone.

Return value: JSON {"route":"customer-update","params":"ID:{cust_id}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or a string 'ID[{$user_id}] EPOS ID[{$epos_customer_id}]';

Takes the EskimoEPOS order ID as the parameter. 

Return value: JSON {"route":"order","params":"Order ID:{order_id}","nonce":"0753674aae","result":[]}
Result is false for no import, or a string 'Order ID[{order_id}]';

** https://domainurl.com/wp-json/eskimo/v1/order-insert/(id:integer) **/

Exports a Woocommerce order to EskimoEPOS by woocommerce order ID. Takes the woocommerce order ID as the parameter.

Woocommerce customer ID, and order number / ID is generated to map the Woocommerce order to the EskimoEPOS order. 

This is set in the EskimoEPOS order ExternalIdentifier field, and also as meta data for the Woocommerce order. 
It is used as validation for future exports. If this field is already filled in the Woocommerce order the export will fail.

The EskimoEPOS system is responsible for real-time tracking of the stock levels from the exported order. 
Products from the order lines should update the EskimoEPOS stock qty. The Woocommerce stock level can then be updated as required by using the /product-update endpoint as above.

Return value: JSON {"route":"order_create","params":"Order ID: #26319","nonce":"911c636231","result":"ID[26319] EPOS WebOrder ID[cxcu-001-000004-5-26319]"} In this case customer prefix: cxcu-, eskimo epos customer: 001-000004, Woocommerce customer ID: 5, Woocommerce order ID: 26319.

By default EskimoEPOS categories are pipe (|) delimited, e.g. 001|MAC||. This character is not a valid unencoded url character. To keep urls clean and avoid manual encoding of the | character the urls replace the | character with a dash (-) e.g. 130|product -> 130-product. 

These are internally translated by the plugin, and stored as their original EskimoEPOS pipe delimited versions.
